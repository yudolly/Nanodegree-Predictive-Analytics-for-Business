This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/predictive-analytics-for-business-nanodegree--nd008). (Previously known as Business Analyst Nanodegree)
## Part 1: Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics
Learn a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. Learn to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. Learn linear regression.

- Project: [Predicting Diamond Prices](Nanodegree-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business/1 Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics/Predicting Diamond Prices.pdf)
- Project: [Predicting Catalog Demand](https://github.com/yudolly/Nanodegree-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/Predicting%20Catalog%20Demand.pdf)

## Part 2: Data Wrangling
Understand the most common data types. Understand the various sources of data. Make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. Learn to write queries to extract and analyze data from a relational database.

- Project: [Create an Analytical Dataset](https://github.com/yudolly/Nanodegree-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/Create%20an%20Analytical%20Dataset.pdf)
- Project: [Create Report from Database (SQL)](https://github.com/yudolly/Nanodegree-Predictive-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/Create%20Reports%20from%20a%20Database.pdf)

## Part 3: Data Visualization 
Understand the importance of data visualization. Know how different data types are encoded in visualizations. Select the most effective chart or graph based on the data being displayed.

- Project: [Visualizing Movie Data]()

## Part 4: Classification Models
You will use classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, forest, and boosted, to make predictions of binary and non-binary outcomes.

- Project: [Predicting Default Risk]()

## Part 5: A/B Testing
Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

- Project: [A/B Test a New Menu Launch]()

## Part 6: Time Series Forecasting
Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models.

- Project: [Forecast Video Game Demand]()

## Part 7: Segmentation and Clustering
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model. Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.

- Project: [Combining Predictive Techniques]()
